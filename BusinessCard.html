<h1>Dancing plague of 1518</h1>
<h3>
    The Dancing Plague of 1518, or Dance Epidemic of 1518, was a case of dancing 
    mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (modern-day France), in the Holy 
    Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Somewhere between 50 and 400 
    people took to dancing for weeks.
</h3>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman called Frau Troffea began to dance
    fervently in a street in Strasbourg.[1] Troffea kept up the constant dancing 
    for a week. Soon, three dozen others joined in.[4] By August, the "dancing 
    plague" had claimed 400 victims.[4] Dancers were beginning to collapse. 
    It is said some even died from a stroke or heart attack.[4] No one knew what 
    caused this reaction, which meant no one understood how to remedy it. 
    By early September, the outbreak began to subside,[5] when the dancers were 
    sent to a mountain shrine to pray for absolution.[4] </p>
<p>    
    Historical documents, including "physician notes, cathedral sermons, local 
    and regional chronicles, and even notes issued by the Strasbourg city council"
    are clear that the victims danced;[1] it is not known why. Historical sources 
    agree that there was an outbreak of dancing after a single woman started dancing,
    [6] and the dancing did not seem to die down. It lasted for such a long time 
    that it even attracted the attention of the authorities; until the council 
    gave up authority to the physicians, who prescribed the afflicted to "dance 
    themselves free of it."[3] There are claims that guild halls were refurbished 
    to accommodate the dancing, as well as musicians and strong people to help 
    keep those dealing with the dancing mania to stay upright.[3] This backfired, 
    and the council was forced to ban public dancing as people danced in fear it 
    was a punishment from Saint Vitus; and to be "free of sin" many joined in on 
    the dancing epidemic.[3] The council went as far as to ban music, as well.[3] 
    Those who danced were then ordered to go to the shrine of Saint Vitus, wore 
    red shoes that were sprinkled with holy water and had painted crosses on the 
    tops and soles.[3] They also had to hold small crosses in their hands; 
    and incense and Latin incantations were part of this "ritual."[3] Apparently 
    "forgiven by Vitus," word was spread of a successful ritual and the Dancing 
    Plague had ended.[3]
</p>
<p>    
    Events similar to this are said to have occurred throughout the medieval age 
    including 11th century in KÃ¶lbigk, Saxony, where it was believed to be the 
    result of demonic possession or divine judgment.[7] In 15th century Apulia, 
    Italy,[8] a woman was bitten by a tarantula, the venom making her dance 
    convulsively. The only way to cure the bite was to "shimmy" and to have the 
    right sort of music available, which was an accepted remedy by scholars like 
    Athanasius Kircher.[9]

    Contemporaneous explanations included demonic possession and overheated blood.

<h2>Modern theories</h2>
<h3>Food poisoning</h3>
<p>
    Some believe[5] the dancing could have been brought on by food poisoning 
    caused by the toxic and psychoactive chemical products of ergot fungi 
    (ergotism), which grows commonly on grains (such as rye) used for baking bread. 
    Ergotamine is the main psychoactive product of ergot fungi; it is structurally 
    related to the drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and is the substance 
    from which LSD-25 was originally synthesized. The same fungus has also been 
    implicated in other major historical anomalies, including the Salem witch 
    trials.[11][12]
</p>
<p>
    In The Lancet, John Waller argues that "this theory does not seem tenable, 
    since it is unlikely that those poisoned by ergot could have danced for days 
    at a time. Nor would so many people have reacted to its psychotropic chemicals 
    in the same way. The ergotism theory also fails to explain why almost every 
    outbreak occurred somewhere along the Rhine and Moselle rivers, areas linked 
    by water but with quite different climates and crops".[2]
</p>
<h3>Stressed-induced mass hysteria</h3>
<p>
    This could have been an example of fully developed cases of psychogenic 
    movement disorder happening in mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness, 
    which involves many individuals suddenly exhibiting the same bizarre behavior. 
    The behavior spreads rapidly and broadly in an epidemic pattern.[13] 
    This kind of comportment could have been caused by elevated levels of psychological 
    stress, caused by the ruthless years (even by the rough standards of the early 
    modern period) the people of Alsace were suffering.[2]
</p>
<p>
    Waller speculates that the dancing was "stress-induced psychosis" on a mass 
    level, since the region where the people danced was riddled with starvation 
    and disease, and the inhabitants tended to be superstitious. Seven other cases 
    of dancing plague were reported in the same region during the medieval era.[1]
</p>
<p>
    This psychogenic illness could have created a chorea (from the Greek khoreia 
    meaning "to dance"), a situation comprising random and intricate unintentional 
    movements that flit from body part to body part. Diverse choreas (St. Vitus' 
    dance, St. John's dance, and tarantism) were labeled in the Middle Ages 
    referring to the independent epidemics of "dancing mania" that happened in 
    central Europe, particularly at the time of the plague.[14][15][16]
